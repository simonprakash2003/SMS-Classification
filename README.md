# SMS-Classification

# Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model for classifying SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing examples of both spam and ham messages, allowing it to accurately identify and filter out spam messages.

# Features

Text Classification: Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques for classifying SMS messages.
Dataset: Trained on a diverse dataset with labeled examples of spam and ham messages.
Scikit-learn and NLTK: Implemented using popular Python libraries for machine learning and natural language processing.
Feature Extraction: Uses techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for feature extraction from text data.
Evaluation Metrics: Provides metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for assessing model performance.

# Results
Our model achieves an accuracy of 90% accuracy on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and ham SMS messages.
